# Bank-Loan-Case-Study

Imagine you're a data analyst at a finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. Your company faces a challenge: some customers who don't have a sufficient credit history take advantage of this and default on their loans. Your task is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that capable applicants are not rejected.

When a customer applies for a loan, your company faces two risks:

If the applicant can repay the loan but is not approved, the company loses business.

If the applicant cannot repay the loan and is approved, the company faces a financial loss.

The dataset you'll be working with contains information about loan applications. It includes two types of scenarios:

Customers with payment difficulties: These are customers who had a late payment of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.

All other cases: These are cases where the payment was made on time.

When a customer applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:

Approved: The company has approved the loan application.

Cancelled: The customer cancelled the application during the approval process.

Refused: The company rejected the loan.

Unused Offer: The loan was approved but the customer did not use it.

Your goal in this project is to use EDA to understand how customer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of default.

Business Objectives:
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have difficulty paying their installments. This information can be used to make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions about loan approval.

Note: To better understand this project, you might want to research a bit about risk analytics in banking and financial services. Understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough.

Data Analytics Tasks:
A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: As a data analyst, you come across missing data in the loan application dataset. It is essential to handle missing data effectively to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

Task: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.

B. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Outliers can significantly impact the analysis and distort the results. You need to identify outliers in the loan application dataset.

Task: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.


C. Analyze Data Imbalance: Data imbalance can affect the accuracy of the analysis, especially for binary classification problems. Understanding the data distribution is crucial for building reliable models.

Task: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.


D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: To gain insights into the driving factors of loan default, it is important to conduct various analyses on consumer and loan attributes.

Task: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.


E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Understanding the correlation between variables and the target variable can provide insights into strong indicators of loan default.

Task: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
